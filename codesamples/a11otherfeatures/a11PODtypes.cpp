POD (Plain Old Data) 

It is both trivial and standard-layout.
Triviality means that it has a straightforward default constructor, 
destructor, and copy/move operations.

Standard-layout ensures that the memory layout is contiguous,
and each member has a higher address than 
the one declared before it.
