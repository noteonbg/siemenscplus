/*

Unlike NULL, which is typically defined as (void*)0,
 nullptr is of type std::nullptr_t
 It is implicitly convertible and comparable to any pointer type or pointer-to-member type.
 However, it is not implicitly convertible or comparable to integral types (except for bool)1.
It avoids ambiguity when overloaded functions accept both pointer and non-pointer arguments.

Dereferencing a NULL pointer causes undefined behavior (e.g., segmentation faults).
Using nullptr helps prevent such issues by providing a well-defined null pointer value.

nullptr consistently favors the pointer version of overloaded functions.
It never accidentally calls the integer version, unlike NULL.
