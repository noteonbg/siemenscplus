Otherwise, it constructs a std::shared_ptr pointing to the same object as the std::weak_ptr.
In other words, lock() provides a safe way to access the resource if it’s still valid,
 returning an empty std::shared_ptr if the resource has been deleted or is no longer valid

/*

We create a std::shared_ptr (sharedPtr) to an instance of MyClass.
Then, we create a std::weak_ptr (weakPtr) from the sharedPtr.
We check if the weakPtr is expired (i.e., if the object has been deleted).
If the weakPtr is still valid, we access the object through it using weakPtr.lock().
Finally, we release the sharedPtr, and the object is destroyed since no other shared pointers hold it.
Remember that std::weak_ptr is useful when you want to avoid circular references
 and break strong ownership cycles. It allows you to safely observe objects without
  keeping them alive indefinitely
