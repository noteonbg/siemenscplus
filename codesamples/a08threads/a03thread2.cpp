The std::lock_guard is a lightweight mutex wrapper in C++. 
It provides an easy-to-use RAII-style mechanism for owning a
 mutex within a scoped block. 

When we create a lock_guard object, it attempts to take ownership of the given mutex.
The mutex is automatically released when the lock_guard object goes out of scope 
(e.g., at the end of the block or function).
