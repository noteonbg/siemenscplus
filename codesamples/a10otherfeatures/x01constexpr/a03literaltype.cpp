/*

In C++, a literal type is a type that can be constructed at compile time,
 and its objects can be used in constant expressions.

class or struct to be considered a literal type, it must satisfy the following conditions:

Trivial Destructor: The destructor must be trivial.
All Base Classes and Non-static Data Members: Must be of literal types.
No Virtual Member Functions: The class cannot have virtual functions or
 virtual base classes.
User-Defined Constructors: Must be constexpr if defined

Built-in Literal Types
  
Integral Types: int, char, bool, long, etc.
Floating-Point Types: float, double.
Pointers: Pointers to objects and functions.
References: References to objects and functions.
