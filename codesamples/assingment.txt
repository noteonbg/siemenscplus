1. 
Write a program that calculates the sum of squares of
 elements in a given vector using a lambda expression 
 with std::accumulate.

2.
Write a program that takes a vector of integers and filters out
 the odd numbers using std::copy_if with a lambda expression.

 3.
 Write a program that filters out components from a vector based
  on a condition using std::remove_if with a lambda expression.

  4.
  mplement a custom algorithm using lambda expressions, such as
   finding the maximum element, counting occurrences of a
    value, or finding the average of elements in a vector.
	
5. implement a calculator which does addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division for integers and floats . think thru various approaches
which is best approach.

6. go thru the code base given and look out the style of c++ programming
and are you familiar with the syntaxes given.

7. copy paste some examples on observer design pattern, proxy design pattern
and factory design pattern.
