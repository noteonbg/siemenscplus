Requirements:
Component Classes:

Define three classes: Resistor, Capacitor, and Inductor.
Each class should have attributes to store the value of the component (e.g., resistance for Resistor, capacitance for Capacitor, and inductance for Inductor).
Provide methods to set and get these values.
Circuit Class:

Define a class Circuit that can contain a collection of Resistor, Capacitor, and Inductor objects.
Implement methods to add components to the circuit.
Implement methods to calculate the equivalent resistance, capacitance, or inductance when components are connected in series or parallel.
Series and Parallel Calculations:

Series Connection:
For resistors in series: 
 
User Interface:

Implement a command-line interface that allows the user to:
Add components to the circuit.
Specify the type of connection (series or parallel).
Calculate and display the equivalent values based on the connection type.
Error Handling:

Handle cases where the user might input invalid values or try to perform calculations on an empty circuit.

sample code may be...

#include "Circuit.h" // Assume this header contains your classes

int main() {
    Circuit myCircuit;

    Resistor r1(100); // 100 ohms
    Resistor r2(200); // 200 ohms

    Capacitor c1(0.01); // 0.01 Farads
    Capacitor c2(0.02); // 0.02 Farads

    myCircuit.addComponent(r1);
    myCircuit.addComponent(r2);
    myCircuit.addComponent(c1);
    myCircuit.addComponent(c2);

    // Example of series connection for resistors
    myCircuit.calculateEquivalentResistance("series");
    // Example of parallel connection for capacitors
    myCircuit.calculateEquivalentCapacitance("parallel");

    return 0;
