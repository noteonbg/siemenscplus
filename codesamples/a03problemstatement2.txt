Problem Statement: Electronic Design Automation Tool

You are tasked with developing an Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool to assist engineers in designing and simulating integrated circuits (ICs). The tool should support the following functionalities:

1. Component Management:
   - Different types of components (e.g., resistors, capacitors, transistors) need to be managed. Each component should have properties and behaviors.

2. Simulation Monitoring:
   - Users need to observe changes in simulation results in real-time. They should be able to subscribe to simulation updates to receive notifications.

3. Access Control:
   - Some components might be sensitive and require access control. Implement a proxy to manage permissions when accessing these components.

4. Template-Based Simulation:
   - Users should be able to define different simulation strategies (e.g., DC analysis, AC analysis) using templates, allowing for easy extension and reusability.

5. Component Visualization:
   - The tool should allow for enhanced visualization of components. Users can decorate components to add additional visual features (e.g., highlighting, tooltips) without changing their core functionality.

Design Requirements

1. Factory Pattern:
   - Implement a factory to create different types of components (e.g., `ComponentFactory` that produces `Resistor`, `Capacitor`, `Transistor` objects).

2. Observer Pattern:
   - Create an observer interface (e.g., `SimulationObserver`) that can be implemented by classes that want to receive updates on simulation changes. The simulation engine will notify all registered observers when state changes occur.

3. Proxy Pattern:
   - Use a proxy class (e.g., `ComponentProxy`) to control access to sensitive components. The proxy should manage permissions and ensure that only authorized users can modify component properties.

4. Template Pattern:
   - Define an abstract class for simulation strategies (e.g., `SimulationTemplate`) with template methods for `setup()`, `run()`, and `cleanup()`. Concrete strategies should extend this class and provide specific implementations.

5. Decorator Pattern:
   - Implement decorators for visual components (e.g., `ComponentDecorator`) that allow users to add visual features to components at runtime without altering their fundamental behavior.

Example Classes

- Factory: 
 cpp
  class ComponentFactory {
  public:
      static std::unique_ptr<Component> createComponent(const std::string& type);
  };
 

- Observer:
 cpp
  class SimulationObserver {
  public:
      virtual void update(const SimulationState& state) = 0;
  };
 

- Proxy:
 cpp
  class ComponentProxy {
  private:
      std::shared_ptr<Component> realComponent;
      User currentUser; // User accessing the component
  public:
      ComponentProxy(std::shared_ptr<Component> component, User user);
      // Access methods with permission checks
  };
 

- Template:
 cpp
  class SimulationTemplate {
  public:
      void runSimulation() {
          setup();
          execute();
          cleanup();
      }
  protected:
      virtual void setup() = 0;
      virtual void execute() = 0;
      virtual void cleanup() = 0;
  };
 

- Decorator:
 cpp
  class ComponentDecorator : public Component {
  protected:
      std::shared_ptr<Component> component;
  public:
      ComponentDecorator(std::shared_ptr<Component> comp) : component(comp) {}
      // Override methods to add functionality
  };
