/*

Decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects dynamically,
 without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
  It’s particularly useful when you need to add functionalities to objects in a
   flexible and reusable way1.


   Base HVAC Device:
We’ll start with a base class called HVACDevice, representing the fundamental HVAC device (e.g., air conditioner or heater).
The base class will have common properties and methods, such as turning the device on/off.

Concrete HVAC Devices:
We’ll create concrete classes for specific HVAC devices (e.g., AirConditioner, Heater).
Each concrete device will inherit from the HVACDevice base class.

Decorator Classes:
We’ll define decorator classes that enhance the behavior of HVAC devices.

Examples of decorators:
TemperatureControlDecorator: Adds temperature control functionality.
TimerDecorator: Allows setting a timer for the device.
EnergySaverDecorator: Optimizes energy consumption.

Usage:
Users can customize their HVAC devices by adding decorators to the base device.
Decorators can be stacked to create complex combinations of features.
