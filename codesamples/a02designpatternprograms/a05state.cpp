/*

An HVAC system can be in various states such as heating, cooling, and idle. The behavior of the system changes based
 on its current state. For instance, in the heating state, it needs to turn on the heater, whereas in the cooling state, 
 it needs to turn on the air conditioner.
 Implementing this with conditional logic can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code.

 We can use the State Pattern to encapsulate the state-specific behavior 
 and transition between states in a clean and maintainable way.

/*

State Interface: HVACState is an abstract base class defining the handle method.
Concrete States: HeatingState, CoolingState, and IdleState inherit from HVACState and implement the handle method.
Context: HVACContext manages the current state and transitions between states.
This C++ implementation follows the State Pattern, where each state-specific behavior is encapsulated in its own class,
 and the HVACContext class manages state transitions and delegates behavior to the current state object.
  This approach results in a more maintainable and scalable codebase, making it easier to add or modify states in
   the future.
